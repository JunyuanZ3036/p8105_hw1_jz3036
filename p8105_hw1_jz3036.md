Homework 1

Problem 1
=========

Create a data frame comprised of:

-   A random sample of size 10 from a uniform\[0, 5\] distribution

``` r
samp = runif(10, min=0, max=5)
samp
```

    ##  [1] 3.1734192 4.9333375 4.1746605 0.2781791 4.1775034 0.2065481 0.2511144
    ##  [8] 4.3880902 4.2624700 3.6986487

-   A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2

``` r
logi_vec = samp > 2
logi_vec
```

    ##  [1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE

-   A (length-10) character vector

``` r
char_vec = c('hello', 'there', '!', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'length-10', 'character', 'vector', ':)')
char_vec
```

    ##  [1] "hello"     "there"     "!"         "this"      "is"       
    ##  [6] "a"         "length-10" "character" "vector"    ":)"

-   A (length-10) factor vector

``` r
fact_vec = factor(c('hello', 'there', '!', 'this', 'is', 'a', 'length-10', 'factor', 'vector', ':)'))
fact_vec
```

    ##  [1] hello     there     !         this      is        a         length-10
    ##  [8] factor    vector    :)       
    ## Levels: :) ! a factor hello is length-10 there this vector

-   Try to take the mean of each variable in your dataframe. What works and what doesnâ€™t? Why?

the mean() function works just fine for numeric values:

``` r
mean(samp)
```

    ## [1] 2.954397

the mean() function even works for logical vectors, the result reflect the proportion of True in the vector:

``` r
mean(logi_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

the mean() function could not work for charactor vector and returned Missing Value, since it makes no sense to count mean of charactors:

``` r
mean(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

similarly, the mean() function could not work for charactor vector and returned Missing Value:

``` r
mean(fact_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(fact_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

-   As shown in the chunk below, this is to try using as.numeric() function to the logical, character, and factor variables.
    -   For logic vector, as.numeric() function converts "True" into 1, "False" into 0.
    -   For character vector, since as.numeric() function doesn't know how to convert those in to number, it's forced to return "NA" as missing value.
    -   for factor vector, as.numeric() function concerts it into numbers representing the level of each character in the vector.

``` r
as.numeric(logi_vec)
as.numeric(char_vec)
as.numeric(fact_vec)
```

-   Convert your character variable from character to factor to numeric. What happens?
    -   as.factor() function successfully converted character vector into factor, and automatically set the level to each character.
    -   then the as.numeric() function converted the new factor vector into numeric numbers according to the level of each character.

``` r
new_fact_vec = as.factor(char_vec)
new_fact_vec
```

    ##  [1] hello     there     !         this      is        a         length-10
    ##  [8] character vector    :)       
    ## Levels: :) ! a character hello is length-10 there this vector

``` r
as.numeric(new_fact_vec)
```

    ##  [1]  5  8  2  9  6  3  7  4 10  1

-   convert your factor variable from factor to character to numeric. What happens?
    -   as.character() function successfully concerted factor vertor into character vector.
    -   While as.numeric() function still failed and returned missing value.

``` r
new_char_vec = as.character(fact_vec)
new_char_vec
```

    ##  [1] "hello"     "there"     "!"         "this"      "is"       
    ##  [6] "a"         "length-10" "factor"    "vector"    ":)"

``` r
as.numeric(new_char_vec)
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

    ##  [1] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA
